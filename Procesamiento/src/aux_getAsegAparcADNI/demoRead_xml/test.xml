      <text> Images are registered to a downsampled version of the Colins brain. The Colin27 brain is zeropadded to have a cubic isotropic image size  (220x220x220 1mm^3) and downsampled (110x110x110 2mm^3) to be more similar to the DWI resolution &#10;&#9;       A corrected gradient table (rotated_gradient_table) is calculated from multiplying vectors in original table.*xfm file from linearly registering the average b0 from the DWI images to the structural T1-weighted scan&#10;&#9;&#9;   The JHU &quot;Eve&quot; atlas is registered to the subject and average values in each region within the FOV are reported&#10;&#9;   </text>
